    Inputs
    ------
    rmsDistMas : list or numpy.array of float
        RMS variation of relative distance between stars across a series of visits.
    annulus : 2-element list or tuple
        inner and outer radius of comparison annulus [arcmin]
    magrange : 2-element list or tuple
        lower and upper magnitude range
    level : str
        One of "minimum", "design", "stretch" indicating the level of the specification desired.
    x : int
        Which of AM1, AM2, AM3.  One of [1,2,3].

    ------

    -----
    The use of 'annulus' below isn't properly tied to the SRD

     because the rmsDistMas has already been calculated for an assumed D.
